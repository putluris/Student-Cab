Database is an organized collection of data. The data is typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring 
information. A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The DBMS essentially serves as an interface 
between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible. 
The DBMS manages three important things: the data, the database engine that allows data to be accessed, locked and modified and the database schema, 
which defines the databaseâ€™s logical structure. These three foundational elements help provide concurrency, security, data integrity and uniform 
administration procedures. The DBMS can offer both logical and physical data independence. That means it can protect users and applications from needing 
to know where data is stored or having to be concerned about changes to the physical structure of data. 
 The main purpose of maintaining database for Studentcab.com is to reduce the transportation problem to the students who are going to schools in 
 buses or cabs. Transportation to these children to ply from home to school and back to home has become an issue of concern as many of the schools 
 are not providing transportation because of various reasons. The situation has left many less options and forcing parents to opt for un-organized 
 transportation such as autos, rickshaws to reach their schools. This kind of transportation is creating tension in the minds of parents as the accident 
 rate is high. This database clearly depicts everything on what are the details parent has registered regarding his son/daughter. Also the vendor of the 
 vehicle who gave his vehicles to the company and the details of vehicle and driver allocation to the student.
